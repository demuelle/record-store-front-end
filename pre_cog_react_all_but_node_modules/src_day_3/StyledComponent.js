      <p>
        Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for
        their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee
        species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. Bees are a
        monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea. They are presently
        considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are over 16,000 known
        species of bees in seven recognized biological families. Some species –
        including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees – live socially in
        colonies while some species – including mason bees, carpenter bees,
        leafcutter bees, and sweat bees – are solitary.
